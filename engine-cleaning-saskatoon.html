                <h3 class="faq-question">Do you use a pressure washer on the engine?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. We use our pressure washer with a different nozzle that does not spray water at high pressure. We use this nozzle for the engine bay as to not damage fragile connections and components of your engine with high pressure water.</p>

            <div class="faq-question-container">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Will this cause damage to my engine?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No it will not. With our process of covering sensative electronics, low pressure water, and blowing out and drying the engine once we are done we will be sure no damage is caused.</p>

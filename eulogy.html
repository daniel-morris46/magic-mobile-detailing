        <p>Who was mam?</p>
        <p>What was mam?</p>
        <p>Why was mam like she was to us all?</p>
        <p>SHE WAS A BLOODY GOOD COOK.</p>
        <p>If you ever wanted to know what a proper Yorkshire Sunday dinner was, mam had it nailed.</p>
        <p>Roast beef, Yorkshire puddings with all the trimmings and like all Yorkshire ladies mam took great pride with her Yorkshire puddings. Often shouts of "Don`t slam the door, puddings are rising" would go out to anybody entering the house, when puddings were in the oven. I also remember how as a kid I would mildly annoy mam by asking if i could put jam or treacle on my Yorkshire puddings instead of gravy. She always let me.</p>
        <p>Mam was a very proud and humble lady who took pride in her appearance, Never over the top but always neat and tidy, never shabby. Whether mam was pushing a trolley around Morrisons or going for a night out at the Ritz, mam always knew how to dress accordingly. Mam also liked to keep on top with her hair and regular visits to the hairdressers were part of mams lifestyle. Aside from the hairstyle maintenance mam would enjoy the opportunity to chat with the stylists, yes mam was a chatterbox she liked to chat and could hold her own in any company on any topic of conversation, she had that confidence.</p>
        <p>Our childhood upbringing, like most families, we had our ups and downs and at times as a family we found ourselves in stormy waters. In these times mam was always there for us, offering support, safety, sanctuary, and love, lots of love. Mam was our lighthouse, always there, constant, dependable, reassuring. Mam was the glue that held our family together, not just normal glue but super glue. But when the waters were calm, we had laughter, lots of laughter.</p>
        <p>Mam liked to dance, she loved music and when the music played mam didn't need much persuasion to hit the dance floor. The Barry White song "My first, my last, my everything" Is one song that stands out. Every time I hear that song it's easy to picture and remember mam dancing as she did, at family weddings and celebrations. Mam also liked her rugby. Rhinos of course were her team. Mam was especially saddened,as we all were, when one of her favorite player's, a player she really admired for many different reasons, Rob Burrows was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.</p>
        <p>Finally, why! Why did mam do what she did for us, why did she always put us first? Why was she so protective towards us? Why did she care so much. The answer to this question is simple. Love, unconditional love, the love that can only come from a mother. Did we let her down at times, yes, we all did. Did she forgive us, yes always. For all those years, we as her children cannot thank her enough. But now mam is no longer with us in, her spirit will remain within each of us and if we are ever in doubt or need guidance, we all know the light in the Lighthouse will still be shining for us.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being here today to share and celebrate mams life.</p>

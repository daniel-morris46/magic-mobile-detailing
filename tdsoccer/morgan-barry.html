          <p>I began playing TD when the program was in the first years of its development. I used TD as an additional path of soccer to help me advance my skill level. Throughout my time in TD I watched my skills as a player sky rocket because of the game of futsal. Through the game of futsal I was forced to think outside of the box and play quick which ultimately translated to my play in the game of soccer. I noticed my ability to work in tight spaces improved. Peter's coaching style of allowing players to "play" was also crucial in how I developed. It helped me and those around me learn to solve problems on our own which is a vital part of the game of soccer. On top of that TD was an extremely fun and welcoming environment that I truly looked forward to going to everyday and still occasionally get the opportunity to be apart of. I can say with full confidence that TD soccer was one of the major tools I used to help me grow technically as a player and I am so glad it was apart of my life!</p>

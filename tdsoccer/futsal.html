        <p>WHY FUTSAL? also known as fútbol de salón (room football)</p>
        <p>TDsoccer uses futsal as a major developmental tool. What the game does is to take away a players space on the ball. It reduces the amount of time a player has on the ball. The game is intended to be none contact, this takes away any physical advantage a player may have over an opponent. Therefor for a player to beat an opponent the player must use skill, quick thinking, quick feet. The game is also played with a none conventional ball which is designed not to help the player. In order for the player to move the ball the player needs to do the work. The ball is very much the teacher in this game.</p>

        <p><span style="color: red;">World Cup winner Pele: </span>“Futsal was important in helping to develop my ball control, quick thinking, passing… also for dribbling, balance, concentration…futsal was very, very important, no doubt.”</p>
        <p><span style="color: red;">Argentina’s Lionel Messi: </span>“In Argentina, when I was a young boy, I used to play a lot of futsal on the street and with Newell’s Old Boys. It was a really fun game that’s helped me a great deal.”</p>
        <p><span style="color: red;">Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo: </span>“The smaller court helped my footwork skills, the nature of the game made me feel so free when I played. If it wasn’t for futsal, I would definitely not be the player I am today.”</p>
        <p><span style="color: red;">Milan and Brazil forward Robinho: </span>“It helped me to become the player I am today. There you don’t have time to think, you are always tightly marked and you develop a sense for performing in small spaces.”</p>

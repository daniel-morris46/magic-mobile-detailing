        <h3>3. Values:</h3>
        <p>Dedication, hard work, team work, community, inclusivity, and affordability.</p>
        <h3>4. Strategic Plan:</h3>
        <p>The areas at the core of the Strategic Plan are player development, coaching, community, partnerships, organizational structure, and affordability.</p>

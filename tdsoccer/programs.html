            <p>All our programs are game based, which means that at least 90% of our training is in a game setting and up to 10% is technical/tactical instruction. Our objective is to use the game to teach fundamentals of futsal. In the U10-U12 groups, we emphasize individual technical skills. In the U14-U18 groups we introduce and develop futsal tactical skills.</p>

We provide futsal specific training to youth players. Our program has a proven track record of developing a players technical ability to a high level. Futsal is one of the fastest growing indoor sports with many Universities offering programming and scholorships.</p>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>The U15 Boys program aim is to play the game of futsal with a focus on ball possesion and good understading of defensive formation as a team. Player rotation is also taught at this age level as well as set plays, transition, and game management.</p>
        <p>Each training session will typically begin with a shooting drill with conditions added to achieve learning opportunities and get players ready for a game. The philosophy of TDsoccer is very much to let the game be the teacher so we like to get playing games as soon as we can.</p>

Four teams will be made, and each team will play each other in a round robin format. Scores and standings will be recorded for this age level. Games will be refereed by TDsoccer coaches with assistant coaches (parent volunteers) running the benches for each team.</p>
